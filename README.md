```
•	In this project I have taken a grocery store sales data-set then implemented association rule mining .

•	Converted the data to show each unique value as a column.

•	Mined the most frequent item-set with given minimum support as input.

•	Then mined the frequent association rules using apriori algorithm and finally visualized the results
